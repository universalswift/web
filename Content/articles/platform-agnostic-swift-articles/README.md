# Platform-agnostic Swift articles

Whenever I advocate for Swift, the most common aha moment listeners of my marketing speeches have is that it **can be used for platforms not created by Apple ü§Ø**. In my opinion, that's due to most books/tutorials being titled something along the lines of "Introduction to iOS development with Swift". With [Universal Swift](https://www.universalswift.blog), I want to make a small contribution towards a more platform-agnostic future for the Swift community.

## What you can expect

Many amazing resources cover different aspects of the language, but a lot of them use platform-specific examples like `UIViewController`. That's exactly what I want to avoid with posts published on this blog. They can almost be seen as an extension of the [official Swift book üìñ](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/), which is usually the first resource I recommend to everyone interested in learning about the language. This does not mean that you'll see any "foo-bar" code snippets, but more generally applicable examples.

## Pipeline

Since this project is all about the Swift community, I'd love for you to contribute your ideas/requests for specific topics to be covered in upcoming posts by [creating issues on GitHub](https://github.com/universalswift/web/issues) ‚ù§Ô∏è 

## Fun fact

Universal Swift itself is built using Swift and generated with [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish). You can check out the source code [on GitHub](https://github.com/universalswift/web).
